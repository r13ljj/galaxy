max-attempts = 3                     # Must be >=0 (default: number of hosts

# value doesn't make much sense because
# it will just cause an append call to
# immmediately fail. A '1' value means
# that the failover client will try only
# once to send the Event, and if it
# fails then there will be no failover
# to a second client, so this value
# causes the failover client to
# degenerate into just a default client.
# It makes sense to set this value to at
# least the number of hosts that you
# specified.
